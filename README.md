# New tab page
Coded and designed by Nguyen Trung Long. 
## Main features
- Full responsive with flexible box method
- Basic SEO (although no one can search it :v)
- Optimized and minimized css and js
## Why do I create this?
 The new tab page in Cent Browser makes me fell very bad. Although I can add a specific URLs such as google.com, what will happen if I don't have the Internet. So I'd want to create an offline page
## How can I use this?
### Only when you're using chrome or cent (or some browser that allow you to create a specific URL for new tabs)
1. Download and extract or clone this project, save it to D drive
1. Go to settings page of your browser. Search for "new tab", then find the "New tab page" section
1. On the section, find "Use custom URL" and activate the check box
1. Paste this to the input on the right of the check box "file:///D:/newTabPage/index.html"
1. Enjoy it!
