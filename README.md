# New tab page
Coded and designed by Nguyen Trung Long. 
## Main features
- Full responsive with flexible box method
- Basic SEO (although no one can search it :v)
- Optimized and minimized css and js
## Why do I create this?
 The new tab page in Cent Browser makes me fell very bad. Although I can add a specific URLs such as google.com, what will happen if I don't have the Internet. So I'd want to create an offline page
## How can I use this?
### Only when you're using chrome or cent (or some browser that allow you to create a specific URL for new tabs)
- Download and extract or clone this project, save it to D drive
- Go to settings page of your browser. Search for "new tab", then find the "New tab page" section
- One the section, find "Use custom URL" and activate the check box
- Paste this to the input on the right of the check box "file:///D:/newTabPage/index.html"
- Enjoy it!
## Apps used when creating:
- Adobe Photoshop CC 2018
- Adobe Illustrator CC 2018
- Visual Studio Code
- Cent Browser (to check)
